# Jsuper
Jsuper is a project of mine that aims to create a vim/nano like environment. Obviously, console interraction varies from system to system so the application won't be truly portable without some native C++ code designed for each system.

## About
Jsuper is being developed on Windows, so the first builds will be Windows. Eventually I will have other operating systems so that I can develop native code for those operating systems

## Planned Features
* Opening/Editing files
* Saving files (and being able to pick their paths)
* Multi-file support
* Multi-window support

## Why?
Well, that is a question that I can't really answer. I don't doubt that this will rarely be used and even more rarely be a first choice for use of a text editor, but it is my aim to get better at programming. For this reason, it is important to me to make projects that matter and have some utility.

## Thanks
IDK yet, depends on how development goes.
